# Internship Project Portfolio

This repository documents all projects completed during the course of a professional internship focused on applied data analysis and visualization using Python. Each project follows a structured format involving data exploration, statistical analysis, and insight generation.

## Projects Completed

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Sales and Nutritional Data

**Description:**
A menu-driven Python application to perform exploratory data analysis on retail sales and nutritional datasets. The tool computes descriptive statistics, generates behavior-based visualizations, and outputs actionable business recommendations.

**Key Features:**

* Interactive CLI with multiple analysis modules
* Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, std deviation)
* Weekly time series trend analysis
* Segmentation by gender and age
* Bar charts and line plots
* Data-driven recommendation engine

**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy

**Objective:** To practice real-world data analysis workflows, improve reporting skills, and interpret structured insights from raw data.

**Status:** Completed


### 2. Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

**Description:**
A Python-based application to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms. The tool processes tweet text, applies TF-IDF vectorization with additional engineered features, trains classification models, and presents results through multiple visualization options.

**Key Features:**

* Data cleaning pipeline to remove links, usernames, and special characters
* Feature engineering including character count and word count
* TF-IDF vectorization with extra features stacked into the model input
* Sentiment classification into Positive, Neutral, and Negative
* Model comparison between Naive Bayes and Linear SVM
* Confusion matrix heatmaps for both models using Matplotlib
* Comparative bar charts for prediction distributions
* Interactive CLI menu for selecting visualization outputs

**Technologies:**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

**Objective:**
To implement a complete sentiment analysis workflow from raw Twitter data to model training, evaluation, and visualization, while practicing feature engineering, model comparison, and result interpretation.

**Status:**
Completed
